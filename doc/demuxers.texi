@chapter Demuxers
@c man begin DEMUXERS

Demuxers are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow to read the
multimedia streams from a particular type of file.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported demuxers
are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option "--list-demuxers".

You can disable all the demuxers using the configure option
"--disable-demuxers", and selectively enable a single demuxer with
the option "--enable-demuxer=@var{DEMUXER}", or disable it
with the option "--disable-demuxer=@var{DEMUXER}".

The option "-formats" of the ff* tools will display the list of
enabled demuxers.

The description of some of the currently available demuxers follows.
